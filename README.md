## What is GC content ?
GC content is the percentage of neucleotides in the DNA molecule that are either guanine(G) or cytosine(C). 
GC content affects several biological and technical aspects of DNA:
- Thermal Stability: G-C pairs form three hydrogen bonds (compared to two in A-T pairs), making GC-rich regions more thermally stable.
- Gene Regulation: GC-rich regions are often found in promoters and CpG islands, which are key in regulating gene expression.
- Mutation Rates: GC content can influence mutation susceptibility and DNA repair efficiency.
- Sequencing and PCR Efficiency: High GC content can complicate DNA amplification and sequencing due to stronger bonding.

Importance of GC content in the tumor supressor genes ? 

- Mutation Hotspots: GC-rich regions may be more prone to methylation, especially at CpG sites, which can silence gene expression—a common mechanism in cancer.
- Epigenetic Regulation: Aberrant methylation of GC-rich promoters in tumor suppressor genes can lead to gene silencing, contributing to tumorigenesis.
- Therapeutic Targeting: Knowing GC content helps in designing targeted therapies or diagnostic tools (e.g., PCR primers, probes).
- Comparative Genomics: GC content can be used to compare tumor suppressor genes across species or between normal and cancerous tissues.

Key components in gene regulation
promoters 
- Region located in the begining of the gene before  coding region, which acts like the start signal for the transcription process.
- They are the binding sites for the RNA polymerase and transcription factors that help initiate transcription.
- Types of promoters :
     - Core promoter : contains essential elements like TATA box
     - regulatory Promoter : includes enhancers and modulators that enhance the gene expression.

CpG islands 
- Regions in the DNA with higher frequency of CpG sites, where a cytosine(C) is follwoed by a Guanine(G) ; which is linked by a Phosphate hence CpG
- Always found near or within promoters of genes.
- Their role in regulation :
-  unmethylated CpG islands : often associate with acive gene expression.
-  Methylated CpG isalnds : can silenece gene expression, found in cancer or epigenetic regulation.

What is DNA methylation ? 
An epigenetic modification, a chemical chnage to DNA that effects the gene expression without altering the DNA itself. It happens by adittion of the methyl group(-CH3) to the cytosine(C) base in the CpG site. The process is carried by an enzyme called DNA methyltransferases(DNMTs). It affects the followings : 
- Gene silencing : methylation in CpG islands within promoter regions can block transcription and effectively turn off the gene.
- Normal function: methylation helps regulate gene expression during development, X-chromosome inactivation, supression of transposable elements.

What is Aberrant Methylation?
Abnormal patterns of DNA methylation that can disrupts the gene function and contribute the diseases such as cancer. 
Types of abberant methylation: 
- Hypermythelation : Excessive methylation in the CpG islands, which can silence the tumor supressor genes leading to uncontrolled cell growth.
  eg : hypermythelation of BRCA1 or p16INK4a in breast and colon cancers.
- Hypomethylation : Loss of merhylation across the gene, It can cause genomic instability which leads activation of oncogens and reactivation of transposable elements.


Why myethylation matters in cancer research ? 

- Biomarkers: Aberrant methylation patterns can serve as early indicators of cancer.
- Therapeutic targets: Drugs like DNMT inhibitors (e.g., azacitidine) aim to reverse abnormal methylation.
- Personalized medicine: Methylation profiling helps tailor treatments based on individual epigenetic signatures.

Tumorigenesis :  ALso called as carcinogenesis/ oncogenisis, the biological process on how the normal cells transform into cancer cells, which involves series of genetic and epigenetic changes that distrupt the normal cell regulation.
