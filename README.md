 # DNA Sequence analysis for the Tumor supressor genes 

 ## Problem statement 
Analyzing large volumes of biological data, especially in oncogenomics, presents significant challenges that strain the development and impementation of personalized medicine. There are specific genes like oncogens that has potential to cause cancer & tumor supressor genes that plays a critical role in regulating cell growth and preventing cancer. These genes often harbor complex mutations that vary widely between idividulas, making it difficult to identify which genetic changes are clinicaly relevant.The sheer size and complexity of genomic datasets, often involving millions of base pairs and thousands of variants—require advanced computational tools to process, interpret, and visualize the data efficiently.

Bioinformatics enables researchers the analysis and interpretation of complex genetic data, identification of mutations, prediction of their impact, and integration of diverse data types such as genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data. Through this  clinicians can match genetic profiles to targeted therapies, predict treatment responses, and design personalized treatment plans based on a patient’s unique molecular signature,ultimately,  transforming the raw genomic data into actionable insights, bridging the gap between complex biology and individualized cancer care.
