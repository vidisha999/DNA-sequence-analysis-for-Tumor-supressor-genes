 # DNA Sequence analysis for the Tumor supressor genes 

 ## Problem statement 
Analyzing large volumes of biological data, especially in oncogenomics, presents significant challenges that strain the development and impementation of personalized medicine. There are specific genes like oncogens that has potential to cause cancer, and genes named tumor supressors that plays a critical role in regulating cell growth and preventing cancer. These genes often harbor complex mutations that vary widely between idividulas, making it difficult to identify which genetic changes are clinicaly relevant.The sheer size and complexity of genomic datasets, often involving millions of base pairs and thousands of variants require advanced computational tools to process, interpret, and visualize the data efficiently.

Bioinformatics enables researchers the analysis and interpretation of complex genetic data, identification of mutations, prediction of their impact, and integration of diverse data types such as genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data. By using computationaly analyzed data, clinicians can match genetic profiles to targeted therapies, predict treatment responses, and design personalized treatment plans based on a patient’s unique molecular signature. This ultumately transforms the raw genomic data into actionable insights, bridging the gap between complex biology and individualized cancer care.


## Project  Goal 

The primary objective of this project is to  build a modular DNA sequence analysis pipeline that focuses on biologically significant regions of the human genome—such as genes, promoters, enhancers, coding sequences (CDS), and exons—rather than entire chromosomes, which span millions of base pairs. Specifically, the pipeline targets **tumor suppressor genes**, which are essential for regulating cell cycle progression, DNA repair, and apoptosis, but are frequently mutated in human cancers. By extracting genomic sequences from these targeted regions on canonical chromosomes, the pipeline enables precise computation of GC content, identification of open reading frames (ORFs), transcription of DNA to RNA, and translation of RNA to proteins. This focused approach supports accurate annotation, mutation profiling, and biological interpretation of genomic data, laying a foundation for scalable and reproducible analysis in bioinformatics and cancer genomics research.
